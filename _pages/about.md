I am a graduate student in the Mathematics, Vision, and Learning (MVA) Master's program at ENS Paris-Saclay, and I am also pursuing an engineering degree at Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech. My research interests lie at the intersection of Generative AI, 2D/3D Computer Vision, and Mathematical Modeling.

I am currently looking for a 4-month research internship abroad, starting in April 2025, in the field of Generative Models or Computer Vision.

For more details, feel free to check my [CV](/cv), my [portfolio](/portfolio) or [contact me](mailto:mathis.wauquiez@gmail.com).
