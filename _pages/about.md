## About Me

I am a graduate student in the Mathematics, Vision, and Learning (MVA) Master's program at ENS Paris-Saclay, and I am also pursuing an engineering degree at Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech.

My coursework at the MVA master's is focused on the following topics:
* __Deep Learning__ and its best practices
* __Computer Vision__ courses, delving into the latest research papers and implementing state-of-the-art models and common problems in computer vision.
* __3D__: 3D computer vision, 3d geometry and geometric deep learning
* __Inverse problems in computer vision__: One specific about image denoising, another about numerical imagery and inverse problems. One course focused on restauration and synthesis of images
* __Generative Models__: Three courses about generative models, plus applications to Plug&Play methods
* __Graph Machine Learning__ course, during which I learned mathematical tools for graphs and graph neural networks
* __Representation Learning__ is one of the most interesting courses I had, although not directly connected to my research interests
* __Bayesian Machine Learning__ is also an interesting course that gave me a global view of the current limitations of Bayesian approaches and the research landscape, as well as giving me a high-level overview of the main approaches to making decisions under uncertainty
* __Learning for time series__ equipped me with the tools needed to tackle time series forecasting, extract meaningful patterns, enhance the data and apply change-point and anomaly detection


And here is my coursework at the ENPC:
* __Spanish & English courses__
* __Optimization methods__, including __convex__/__non convex__ optimization, linear programming and dynamic programming
* __Optimal Control__, teached by Pf. [Amaury Hayat](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~hayata/)
* __Computer Vision__ course that introduced me classical computer vision techniques, teached by [Vincent Lepetit](https://vincentlepetit.github.io)
* __Machine Learning__ theoretical and practical (JAX) course
* __Stochastic Processes__ (MDPs, Martingales)
* __Statistics in high dimensions__
* __Deep Learning__, teached by [Mathieu Aubry](https://mathieuaubry.github.io)
* __Data Science__
* __Advanced Algorithmics__ (C++)
* __Scientific Computational Algorithms__ (Julia)
* __Numerical Analysis / Calculus / Probabilities__ courses

But also ...
* __Economics__
* __Mechanics__, teached by [Luc Dormieux](https://ecoledesponts.fr/luc-dormieux)
* __Geomechanics__
* __Statistical Physics__
* __Epistemology__
* __Sustainable Development__
* __Law__

## How you can help me

I am currently looking for a 4-month research internship abroad, starting in April 2025, in the field of Generative Models or Computer Vision.
