## Who am I?

Iâ€™m a graduate student currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Mathematics, Vision and Learning at the Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris-Saclay, along with an engineering degree at Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech.

Iâ€™m also a research intern at TÃ©lÃ©com Paris, in the IMAGES team (Image, Data, and Signal Department). I work under the supervision of [Yann Gousseau](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/), [Alasdair Newson](https://sites.google.com/site/alasdairnewson/home?authuser=0), and [AndrÃ©s Almansa](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~aalmansa/HomePage/). This internship is expected to stop the 26th of September.
My current research focuses on advancing the use of **flow matching techniques** for solving **image inpainting** problems.

Previously, I did a research internship at [GRASP Earth](https://www.grasp-earth.com), where I studied the use of VAEs applied to massive satellite data clustering, which was useful for several downstream tasks, including land change detection, or air quality monitoring.

My academic interests lie in **Generative Models** and **Computer Vision**, which Iâ€™ve explored through research projects and coursework in the MVA program and at ENPC.

## Open to Research Opportunities

Iâ€™m currently looking for a **6-month internship**, starting **October 2025**, in **Generative Models**.

This will be the **final internship of my studies**, and it can potentially be continued as a **PhD** or a **job**.
