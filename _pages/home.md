I am a graduate student in the Mathematics, Vision, and Learning (MVA) Master's program at ENS Paris-Saclay, and I am also pursuing an engineering degree at Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech.

My academic interests lie in the field of Generative Models and Computer Vision, which I am currently exploring through my research projects and my courses at the MVA.

## How can you help me?

I am currently looking for a 4-month research internship abroad, starting in April 2025, in the field of Generative Models or Computer Vision.
