This project was part as the TDLOG course at the ENPC. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the world of software engineering and project management, showing the agile development process and the importance of good practices. The project was to create a game replicating the famous "diep.io" game, but in space. We had to create a game engine from scratch, and then implement the game logic. One of the most interesting part of this project was to find good ways to collaborate with other members of the team, with a very high variety of backgrounds and skills. The final product was a playable game, that could be improved a lot, but that was a great learning experience, for which I am very grateful.
