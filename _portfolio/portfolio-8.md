Hackathon project for the Theodo Dojo. The goal was to create a Spotify blind test, where the user has to guess the song that is playing, based on a few seconds of audio. The project was done in an evening, and we had to use the Spotify API to get the audio features of the songs, and then let the user guess the song. 

I had never worked with React, Typescript and react-query, which I wanted to learn. I am proud to have achieved so much features in such a short time.
