A 3D maze game I created during highschool. The goal was to create a maze game with a 3D environment, in hich he player can move around the maze using the arrow keys.

The maze generation is done using queues and is already a challenge in itself for highschool students. The pseudo-3D was created from scratch, and the rendering is done through pygame and OpenGL-python.
