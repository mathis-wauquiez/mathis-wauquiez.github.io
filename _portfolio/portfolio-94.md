# 3D Rendering Engine

This was a project I worked on during high school. The initial goal was to explore the basics of how 3D rendering engines work while creating a small program to apply the knowledge I had acquired. I followed an online tutorial on the fundamentals of rendering engines. This project was also an opportunity for me to learn more about linear algebra in this context, including projections, rotation matrices, etc.

Although it is not a very advanced project, the code is quite clear and self-explanatory. It was also one of the first times I used classes to write clean code.
