Project completed in high school. I discovered the basics of signal processing and Fourier transforms through my TPE, which focused on satellite communications. Determined to create a game controlled solely by the player's whistling, I independently learned about Fourier transforms. After developing an algorithm to detect the main frequency of the whistle, I implemented a real-time audio processing system using pyaudio to handle microphone input in short audio segments. This implementation was then integrated into a Flappy Bird game that I developed.
