In high school, as part of my computer science specialization, I implemented this cellular algorithm in a Pygame application, which also allows loading and saving configurations.  
This was my first cellular algorithm, followed by a few others, including Brian's Brain and the Sandpile algorithm. 
The interface allows adding cells, starting and pausing the simulation, as well as saving and loading configurations.  
Great emphasis was placed on **code optimization**, particularly through **vectorization** with NumPy, and this was my first project that truly leveraged this library.
