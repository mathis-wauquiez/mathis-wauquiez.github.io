Project description
==============
A group project where, in collaboration with GRASP, we explored a range of clustering algorithms, applied to years worth of satellite data acquired by the POLDER instruments aboard the PARASOL microsat.

One of our key achievements is the use of a modified variational autoencoder to create a clustering of the data, used to naturally explore the dependencies between our data and the natural land types.
