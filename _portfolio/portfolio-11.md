The objective of this work was to analyze the surface settlements observed following tunnel excavation. First,the data is organized in a database structure and then processed. Then, a statistical study is done in order to better understand the data. Finally, simple machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests are used for the prediction of settlements. The obtained results are compared with those measured in the field in order to validate the quality of the prediction

This project was done as part of the [ENPC](https://www.enpc.fr/en) 1st year program, in close collaboration with Dr. [Tatiana Richa](https://ingenius.ecoledesponts.fr/auteurs/tatiana-richa/), a specialist in geotechnical engineering and data science, that supervised us throughout the project.
